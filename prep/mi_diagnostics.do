**********
* Monash Myeloma Model - MI diagnostics
*
* Purpose: Missing-data diagnostics for the imputed BASELINE COVARIATES that enter the risk
*          equations -- demographics (Male), performance status (ECOGcc), R-ISS (and its inputs),
*          and comorbidities (CM_CKD/CRD/PLM/DBT) -- plus the first-line response (BCR_L1), read off
*          the saved MRDR Long MI.dta at each variable's own record. Reports per variable: the
*          pre-imputation percent missing, then the relative increase in variance (RVI), the
*          fraction of missing information (FMI), the relative efficiency of the current number of
*          imputations (RE) and the imputation-adjusted degrees of freedom (DF) -- the figures that
*          justify the number of imputations and go in a manuscript's missing-data methods.
* Usage:   do "prep/mi_diagnostics.do"   (needs the MRDR drive; reads $data_path/MRDR Long MI.dta,
*          the main-model output of multiple_imputation.do run with $imp set to the reporting M).
* Notes:   Diagnostics only -- reads the imputed data, never rebuilds it. Deliberately kept out of
*          multiple_imputation.do so the production build (including the 500-iteration bootstrap on
*          the HPC) stays lean and its logs uncluttered. FMI and RE only settle as M grows, so read
*          them off the main M=10 model, not a 2-imputation run. These covariates also enter the
*          OS (streg) and ASCT (logit) equations; for the FMI/DF of those COEFFICIENTS as fitted,
*          add `vartable` / `dftable` to the matching `mi estimate` calls in prep/risk_equations.do.

* Write a plain-text log to scratch/ (local + git-ignored via *.log; the MRDR drive is not readable
* off-Stata) so the results can be reviewed after a drive run. Named log -> coexists with any log
* already open in an interactive session. Convention documented in CLAUDE.md.

* Fail fast (and close the log) if the MRDR share is not mounted -- otherwise the first `use` throws
* a bare r(601) and leaves this log open to catch whatever runs next in the session.

* Baseline covariates entering the risk equations, at the diagnosis record (Event0 == 3, one row
* per patient), grouped by how the FMI is best summarised:
*   binary / continuous -> mean ;  ordinal (>2 levels) -> proportion (FMI per level).

* SANITY: does BCR actually vary across the imputations? Zero between-imputation variance everywhere,
* even where ~26% is imputed, usually means the draws collapsed. Count rows whose m-th imputed value
* differs from the first imputation, for BCR and for a known-varying imputed control (eGFR). If BCR is
* ~0 while eGFR is large, the response imputations are (near-)identical -- a real issue in the response
* imputation, not a diagnostic artefact. (M = 10 imputations in the main model.)
