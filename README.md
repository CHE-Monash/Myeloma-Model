A comprehensive discrete-event simulation model for multiple myeloma disease outcomes and treatment pathways, developed through collaboration between Monash University's Centre for Health Economics and Transfusion Research Unit.

## What's New in v3.0

- **Calibrated Transport methods**: out-of-trial outcome prediction (e.g. DVd at L2) via the `transport_dvd` analysis
- **Common Random Numbers (CRN)**: aligned RNG across treatment arms for variance-reduced cost-effectiveness comparisons
- **Standardised CSV exports**: machine-readable result surface for downstream and programmatic use
- **Vectorised engine** (incorporated from v2.1): Mata vector/matrix rewrite for dramatically faster large-scale simulation
- **Rebrand**: project renamed from EpiMAP Myeloma to the Monash Myeloma Model

## Model Overview

The model simulates the complete treatment journey of multiple myeloma patients using **30 evidence-based risk equations** derived from the Australia and New Zealand Myeloma and Related Diseases Registry (MRDR).

### Key Features

- **Patient Characteristics**: Age, sex, ECOG performance score, R-ISS staging & co-morbidity score
- **Treatment Pathways**: Comprehensive modelling of up to 9 lines of therapy
- **Clinical Outcomes**: Best Clinical Response (BCR) and Overall Survival (OS)
- **ASCT Modelling**: Separate pathways for transplant-eligible patients
- **Maintenance Therapy**: Post-induction treatment modelling
- **Parametric Survival Models**: Time-to-event analysis for all outcomes
- **High Performance**: Mata implementation for efficient large-scale simulations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Stata 15.0 or higher** (valid licence required)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system

### Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/CHE-Monash/Myeloma-Model.git
cd Myeloma-Model
```

### Basic Usage

Each analysis is driven by its own dispatcher in `analyses/<name>/`. Configure a run by editing the globals at the top of the dispatcher, then run it from Stata:

``` stata
cd "path/to/myeloma-model"
do "analyses/base_model/base_model.do"
```

#### Configuration

The dispatcher's configuration block sets the run via globals (there are no positional arguments):

| Global | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `analysis` | Analysis name (folder under `analyses/`) | `base_model` |
| `int` | Intervention | `all`, `VRd`, `SoC`, `DVd` |
| `line` | Line of therapy assessed (1–9; `0` = all) | `0` |
| `coeffs` | Coefficient set | `base_model` |
| `data` | Patient data | `population`, `predicted` |
| `min_year` / `max_year` | Diagnosis-year range | `1995` / `2040` |
| `min_id` / `max_id` | Patient ID range | `1` / `101212` |
| `boot` | Bootstrap flag (0/1) | `0` |
| `min_bs` / `max_bs` | Bootstrap iteration range | `1` / `100` |
| `cost_year` | Price year for costs (AUD) | `2025` |
| `drate` | Annual discount rate (PBAC = 5%) | `0.05` |
| `report` | Generate PDF report (0/1) | `0` |
| `scenario` | Scenario label | `Base` |

#### Available Analyses

| Dispatcher | Focus |
|---|---|
| `analyses/base_model/base_model.do` | All regimens — current-practice projections |
| `analyses/vrd_post/vrd_post.do` | VRd at LoT 1, post-market impact |
| `analyses/transport_dvd/transport_dvd.do` | DVd via Calibrated Transport |

Results are written to `analyses/<analysis>/simulated/`.

## Result Exports

Each simulation can emit a PDF report (`$report`) and machine-readable **flat CSV** outputs for downstream use (R/Python post-processing, dashboards, manuscript drafting). CSV export is produced for point-estimate runs and skipped under bootstrap.

- **Engine-level** — `core/export_results.do` writes the CSVs every analysis needs (per-patient summary, BCR distribution, mean cost/QALY/LY) into `simulated/<scenario>/`.
- **Analysis-level** — outputs specific to one analysis, plus cross-scenario aggregation, live under `analyses/<name>/results/` with a `results.md` summarising the key figures — the canonical read surface for downstream consumers.

See each analysis README (e.g. `analyses/transport_dvd/README.md`) for specifics.

## Performance Improvements in v3.0

The vectorised implementation provides significant performance benefits:

- **Faster Execution**: Matrix operations process all patients simultaneously
- **Better Memory Efficiency**: Reduced overhead from loop-based processing
- **Scalability**: Handles large cohorts (10,000+ patients) more efficiently
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure with modular vector setup

## Validation

The model has been comprehensively validated:

- **Published Validation**: See Irving et al. (2024) in PLOS ONE
- **Out-of-Sample Testing**: 70/30 split validation with 100 bootstrap iterations
- **Survival Curve Accuracy**: No significant difference in 90% of 120 months post-diagnosis
- **Vectorisation Validation**: Comprehensive test suite confirms identical results to original implementation

## Version History

Access previous versions via Git tags:

- **v3.0**: Current version — Calibrated Transport & CRN methods, standardised CSV exports, rebrand to Monash Myeloma Model (incorporates the v2.1 vectorised engine)
- **v2.1**: Vectorised Mata implementation (backward compatible)
- **v2.0**: Reorganised architecture with extended treatment options
- **v1.0**: Initial public release (August 2024) - `git checkout v1.0`
